            <p>Spiderman is a guy named Peter Parker. He grew up in Queens, New York with his aunt. 
                He has been associated with almost every Marvel branch and is an iconic figure and an inspriation for many.
                <br>
                He first appeared in the early 1960's and was considered quite different. z
                This was due to the fact he was one of the few teenage main characters.
                <br> 
                He usually wears a red, black, white, and blue skintight suit with spider web designs and a spider on his chest. 
                In recent history, he is also known as a part of the avengers and a character with multiple solo movies. 
                <br>
                Like many Marvel characters, he was also created by the late Stan Lee.</p>

            <p>I chose this character as a hero because he was my hero when I was younger. He was infact a 'super'hero.
                He is also an inspiration for many. He has done great tasks and is a figure known worldwide.
                <br>
                His story also shows how a guy with a normal life can grow into somebody better.
                The grounded roots also show how Spiderman relates to normal people.
                <br>
                That relation makes him a great inspiration, a great hero, and someone everyone should look up to.</p>
