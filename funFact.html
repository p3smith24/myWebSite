        /*************** Algorithm ******************
        1. code start to detect when both dropdowns have been selected
        2. start should also then use getIndex() to find the index related to the selected elements.
        3. getindex needs to be coded with a way of interpreting incoming "d" variables to give back an index in an array
        4. these need to have a way to communicate to produce a piece of text from the dropdown and selected menus
        5. start needs to call it all and conglomerate getIndex and run code.
        5. The facts for the specific dropdowns then need to be written.
        6. This needs to be thoroughly tested 
        7. make it all pretty up
