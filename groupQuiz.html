Algorithm :
1. Make the varible for the answers, questions, score, and tracking questions and answers.
2. Make the update score, easily update the score
3. Make checkAnswer compare the value of the answer box to the answers[onAnswer]
4. let displayQuestion() display the next question when called
5. make an end() function to add for special parameters at the end of the quiz.
6. make a reset() function to reset the quiz at the end to take it again without reloading the page.
7. Pretty it up with some CSS
8. Make there be two buttons so a reset may be commenced at any time.
9. Add a start button to make the quiz a little less abrupt.
10. Add good questions with single word answers that can be called on without case sensitivity.
